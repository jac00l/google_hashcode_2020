    "## Abstract\n",
    "The following document is a code review for the solution of NP-Hard problem, described by Google in Google Hashcode 2020 problem statement. This problem has been assigned as a semester project for Combinatorial Optimization course by M.Sc. Jarosław Synak. The given problem is NP-Hard, we decided to implement the Genetic Algorithm. We also decided to update GA principals to meet our needs. The key difficulty occurred finding good heuristic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the method\n",
    "A genetic algorithm are randomized search algorithms that is inspired by and made to imitate the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics.It reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose it mostly because the genetic algorithm can easily be adjusted to the problem at hand. Almost any aspect of the algorithm may be changed and customized.\n",
    "Also, it is worth noting that GA has a lot of advantages, eg. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The concept is easy to understand\n",
    "* It's stochastic\n",
    "* It searches from a population of points, not a single point\n",
    "* It doesn't require any derivative information (There is every possibility that there may not be any information that we can rely on based on the problem).\n",
    "* It's faster and efficient when compared to the traditional methods of brute-force/greedy search.\n",
    "* It hase many parallel capabilities\n",
    "* Optimizes both continuous and discrete functions and also multi-objective problems."

Another factor which we decided to take into account was time necessary to sign up the library - we want to minimize this factor, so we put it in the denominator. The last factor, which changed the results of our program was the variance of books' scores in the library. In some test cases, for some libraries variance was equal to zero, so we added substitution with 0.01 if variance equals 0. At the end we take square root of value computed using previously described steps, to make more probable to choose also libraries with lower values.
