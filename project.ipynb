    "The following document is a code review for soultion of NP-Hard problem, described by Google in Google Hashcode 2020 problem statement. This problem has been stated as semester project for Combinatorial Optimization course by M.Sc. Jarosław Synak. Given problem is NP-Hard, so we decided to implement Genetic Algorithm. We decided to update  GA principals to meet our needs. The key difficulty occured finding good heuristic function."
