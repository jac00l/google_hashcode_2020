[int] days_number
Number of days. Time period available for signing and scanning.
For instance: 80

[tuple] books
List of all books' scores.
For instance: (1, 2, 3)

    [int] books[i]
        Score of a book of ID 'i'. Example: If books[0] equals 10, then score of book of ID 0 equals 10.
        For instance: 20

[tuple] libraries
List of all libraries. Length of this tuple equals libraries_number
For instance (((3, 2, 1), (2, 17, 3)), ..., ...)

    [tuple] libraries[i]
    Tuple of data and books available in library of ID 'i'.
    For instance ((3, 2, 1), (2, 17, 3))

        [tuple] libraries[i][0]
        Tuple of data about library of ID 'i'. Size of this tuple is fixed to 3.
        For instance: (3, 2, 1)

            [int] libraries[i][0][0]
            Number of books available in library of ID 'i'.
            For instance: 3

            [int] libraries[i][0][1]
            Number of days library of ID 'i' requires to sign up.
            For instance: 2

            [int] libraries[i][0][2]
            Number of books that may be shipped to scan center per day.
            For instance: 1
        
        [tuple] libraries[i][1]
        Tuple containg IDs of books available in the library of ID 'i'
        For instance: (2, 17, 3)

### RUNNING SCRIPT

[list] population
List containg many solutions and their values. For more specific info about solutions see bellow.
For instance: [(20, solution2), (30, solution1)]

    [int] population[0]
    Value of a single, particular and complete solution.
    For instance: 90

    [tuple] population[1]
    Solution. For more specific info about solutions see bellow.

### OUTPUT

[tuple] solution
Tuple containg one, particular, solution of a problem. Length of this tuple is fixed to 2.
For instance: (2, (1, 3, (5, 2, 3)), (0, 5, (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)))

    [tuple] solution[i][0]
    Number of libraries that will be signed up for scanning (in solution of ID 'i').
    For instance: 2

    [tuple] solution[i][j] (constraint: 1 >= j >= solution[i][0])
    Information about library which will be signed up as a j-th one.
    For instance: (1, 3, (5, 2, 3))

        [int] solution[i][j][0]
        ID of a library which will be signed up as a j-th one.
        For instance: 1

        [int] solution[i][j][1]
        Amount of books which will be signed up for scanning.
        For instance: 3

        [tuple] solution[i][j][2]
        IDs of books that will be send for scanning from library of ID solution[i][j][0], id order
        For instance: (5, 2, 3)
